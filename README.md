# DS 3001 Project - Optimizing Music Recommendation
#### Joe Leonard (ymd3tv) & Alex Laplace (hqr7gc)

In this project, we will be looking at Spotify track data in order to optimize the way new music is recommended to listeners. We'll be finding similar-sounding songs while incorporating different variables to keep recommendations from becoming repetitive. The reason we chose to go this route is because we are both in bands at UVA and thought it would be a cool way to incorporate that into our data science work. 

For help on this, we've referred to previous work using the following links:

The first article by Sandler Dieleman highlights work he did as a summer intern for Spotify that allowed him to create tons of different playlists based on song similarity.
